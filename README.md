## Project Description
The ABC University Course Planner is a C++ console application. It allows the user to view and search courses and prerequisites within the ABC University network. The application loads course data from a csv file and displays the data to the users in a text-based menu. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate data structures, file I/O, user input handling, and sorting algorithms. 

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Hash Tables: Used for storing and retrieving course data quickly by using course numbers as keys
- Vectors: Used for sorting and managing course lists
- File I/O: Reads course data from a CSV file line-by-line
- Sorting: Course are sorted alphanumerically by course number
- User Input Handling: Obtains and validates user selections and input
- Modular Design: Separate functions to allow for modularity

## How to Run
1. Ensure the csv file "ABCU_Advising_Program_Input.csv" is added to your project
2. Compile and run the program
3. Select options 1,2,3, or 9 from the menu and follow prompts.
